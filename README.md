# ðŸš¢ Modern ship Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project applies various supervised machine learning algorithms to predict survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset is taken from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Load and clean modern ship dataset
- Handle missing values and encode categorical features
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest
- Compare model performances using accuracy and classification reports
- Visualize feature correlations and feature importance

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
    
## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available in this repository:

ðŸ‘‰ [Dataset.csv](./train.csv)

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

- Heatmap of feature correlation
- Pairplots for numeric features
- Feature importance bar chart from Random Forest
